<p>I'm a born and raised Detroiter and I love my city.
	<br>
I'm a full time multidisciplinary artist working in lens based media, writing, and production with a social justice foundation.
	<br>
I love Community, freedom, and living in practice, not just theory.
	<br>
If I'm creating, I'm most happy; music, film, media, food, moments, new futures.
	<br>
I started coding in high school with my father. His car talks, flies drones, and a lot of other cool things pre "Alexa".
	<br>
I'm a Saggitarius true to my name. Very chill yet fiery, freedom loving, curious, MOVING.
	<br>
I have a deep love for beautiful aesthetics.
	<br>
I'm an avid book lover...but ask me if I've read the books I buy constantly and continue to buy.
<br>
With the right music I can accomplish anything.
</p>


<p id="year">This year, I'm looking forward to aligning my creative pizazz with world of tech.
	Not leaving my love for uplifting social equity and the arts behind, I hope to be positioned in sectors that 
	focus on utilizing tech as a means of algorithmic fairness, encouraging equity in marginalized communities and making tech available and digestible for all.
